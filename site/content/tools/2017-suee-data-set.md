description: "The data sets contain traffic in and out of the web server of the Student Union for Electrical Engineering (Fachbereichsvertretung Elektrotechnik) at Ulm University. Internal hosts are hosts from within the university network, some of them are cable bound, others connect through one of two wifi services on campus (eduroam and welcome). The data was mixed with attack traffic."
