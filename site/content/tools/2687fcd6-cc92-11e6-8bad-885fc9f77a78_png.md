Data Collection



  You need to wait several days (depending on the number of power on/off of the PC), before getting any data.



  After getting the email copy the full message to a text file. 
  
  As the message has come through email certain characters are converted. To resolve that --- --- ---. 



  Now, run DecodeMessage.exe for decoding the message as plain text. 
  
  In this phase, you can look for specific patterns in the text, and thus get rid of most of the useless parts (like- mouse click, or same key-group press as happens during gaming).
