Add the run_responder() function to the file api.py of TheHive4py
In order to send emails to the user, ThePhish uses the Mailer responder. Since ThePhish uses TheHive4py to interact with TheHive, a function that allows running a responder by its ID is needed. Unfortunately, this function is not part of TheHive4py yet, but a pull request has been made to add it to TheHive4py (). While waiting for it to be added, it must be manually added using the following command for ThePhish to work properly (replace the version of Python in the command if you use a different version of Python):
$ (cat << _EOF_


    def run_responder(self, responder_id, object_type, object_id):
        req = self.url + \"/api/connector/cortex/action\"
        try:
            data = json.dumps({ \"responderId\": responder_id, \"objectType\": object_type, \"objectId\": object_id})
            return requests.post(req, headers={\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}, data=data, proxies=self.proxies, auth=self.auth, verify=self.cert)
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            raise TheHiveException(\"Responder run error: {}\".format(e))
_EOF_
