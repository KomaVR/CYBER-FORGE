title: "Advanced x86: Introduction to BIOS & SMM"
description: "

We will cover why the BIOS is critical to the security of the platform. This course will also show you what capabilities and opportunities are provided to an attacker when BIOSes are not properly secured. We will also provide you tools for performing vulnerability analysis on firmware, as well as firmware forensics. This class will take people with existing reverse engineering skills and teach them to analyze UEFI firmware. This can be used either for vulnerability hunting, or to analyze suspected implants found in a BIOS, without having to rely on anyone else.
