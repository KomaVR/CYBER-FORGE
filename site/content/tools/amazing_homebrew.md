Unlimited \"Developer Mode\" access

While LG allows willing Homebrew developers/users to install unofficial
applications onto their TVs, official method requires manual renewal of
\"developer mode session\", which expires after 50 hours of inactivity.
Some of the  that has been
built/ported onto webOS would likely never be accepted onto LG's official
Content Store.
