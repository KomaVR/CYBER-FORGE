description: "General:

Minimal host system requirements due to dockerization of every step
An easy to grasp configs/user.ini config that allows highly customizable sessions

Or provide different configurations for different debugging setups via the command-line!


CTF runner that's specifically designed to handle Linux kernel exploitation challenges

ctf/misc that houses some nifty scripts to aid in CTFs


Code quality measures:

 formatter for python code
flake8 linter for all python code
shellcheck linter for shell scripts
hadolint linter for the Dockerfiles


Operating system agnostic, meaning it should run just fine on:

Debian/Ubuntu
Arch Linux/Manjaro
Fedora
