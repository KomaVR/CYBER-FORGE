title: "CNIT 123 - Ethical Hacking and Network Defense"
description: "

Students learn how hackers attack computers and networks, and how to protect systems from such attacks, using both Windows and Linux systems. Students will learn legal restrictions and ethical guidelines, and will be required to obey them. Students will perform many hands-on labs, both attacking and defending, using port scans, footprinting, exploiting Windows and Linux vulnerabilities, buffer overflow exploits, SQL injection, privilege escalation, Trojans, and backdoors.
