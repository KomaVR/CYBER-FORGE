title: "dnsmasq conversion script"
description: "
This GitHub gist has a short shell script (bash, will work on any 'nix) and
uses wget & awk present in most distros, to fetch a specified hosts file
and convert it to the format required by dnsmasq. Supports IPv4 and IPv6.
Designed to be used as either a shell script, or can be dropped into
/etc/cron.weekly (or wherever suits). The script is short and easily edited,
also has a short document attached with notes on dnsmasq setup."
