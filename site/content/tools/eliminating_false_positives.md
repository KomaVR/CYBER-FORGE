title: "Eliminating false positives"
description: "As the data provided by Microsoft's MSRC feed is frequently incomplete and false positives are reported by wes.py, @DominicBreuker contributed the --muc-lookup parameter to validate identified missing patches from the systeminfo.txt file against Microsoft's Update Catalog. Additionally, make sure to check the  page at the Wiki on how to interpret the results.
For an overview of all available parameters for missingkbs.vbs, missingkbs.ps1 and wes.py, check CMDLINE.md."
