title: "Emerging Threats - Open Source"
description: "Emerging Threats began 10 years ago as an open source community for collecting Suricata and SNORTÂ® rules, firewall rules, and other IDS rulesets. The open source community still plays an active role in Internet security, with more than 200,000 active users downloading the ruleset daily. The ETOpen Ruleset is open to any user or organization, as long as you follow some basic guidelines. Our ETOpen Ruleset is available for download any time."
