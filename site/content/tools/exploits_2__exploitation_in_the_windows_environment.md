title: "Exploits 2: Exploitation in the Windows Environment"
description: "

This course covers the exploitation of stack corruption vulnerabilities in the Windows environment. Stack overflows are programming flaws that often times allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a vulnerable program. There are many nuances involved with exploiting these vulnerabilities in Windows. Window's exploit mitigations such as DEP, ASLR, SafeSEH, and SEHOP, makes leveraging these programming bugs more difficult, but not impossible. The course highlights the features and weaknesses of many the exploit mitigation techniques deployed in Windows operating systems. Also covered are labs that describe the process of finding bugs in Windows applications with mutation based fuzzing, and then developing exploits that target those bugs.
