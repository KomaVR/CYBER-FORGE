description: "is a GPT created by MarkCyber in which chatGPT 4 acts as a hacking CTF. This GPT will ask for your experience level and what you would like to improve on, before simulating a machine/application for you to hack into, using the chatbox as the place to input terminal commands. Since this is through AI, it changes and adjust based on your experience level and you can ask for help if you are stuck."
