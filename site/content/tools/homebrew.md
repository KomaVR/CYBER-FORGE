MacOS (using , thanks filippovitale)
brew install asn


Note for MacOS users:
 has a policy not to install any binary with the setuid bit, and mtr (or actually, the mtr-packet helper binary that comes with it) requires to elevate to root to perform traces (good explanations for this can be found here and here). If mtr (and therefore asn) traces are not working on your system, you should either run asn as root using sudo, or set the proper SUID permission bit on the mtr (or better, on the mtr-packet) binary.
