--cro-host-config-file - File to load the Docker host configuration data (JSON format) to use when running the container. See the  struct definition from the go-dockerclient package for configuration details. Note that Slim will automatically add SYS_ADMIN to the list of capabilities and run the container in privileged mode, which are required to generate the seccomp profiles. The host config parameters specified using their standalone build or profile command flags overwrite the values in the host config file (volume binds are merged).
