title: "Hostile"
description: "is a nifty command line utility
to easily add or remove domains from your hosts file. If our hosts files are
too aggressive for you, you can use hostile to remove domains, or you can
use hostile in a bash script to automate a post process each time you
download fresh versions of hosts."
