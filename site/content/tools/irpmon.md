title: "IRPMon"
description: "The goal of the tool is to monitor requests received by selected device objects or kernel drivers. The tool is quite similar to IrpTracker but has several enhancements. It supports 64-bit versions of Windows (no inline hooks are used, only modifications to driver object structures are performed) and monitors IRP, FastIo, AddDevice, DriverUnload and StartIo requests."
