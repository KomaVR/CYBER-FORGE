description: "
ir-rescue-win-v1.4.3: process arguments are now filtered from the output of malware-dlls into a separate file, replaced filesystem-table with a more comprehensive option (filesystem-info) that retrieves disk and partition information, swapped  with exiftool.exe (v10.55) for parsing LNK files, and added a few more commands.
