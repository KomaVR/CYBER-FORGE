title: "LIR allocation"
description: "
It will lookup relevant Autonomous System information for any given AS number, including:

Organization name and RIR region
IXP Presence (Internet Exchange facilities where the AS is present)
Global AS rank (derived from the size of its customer cone, number of peering relationships and more)
BGP statistics (neighbours count, originated v4/v6 prefix count)
BGP incident history (number of BGP hijacks and route leaks involving the target AS in the past 12 months, as a victim or a hijacker)
Peering relationships separated by type (upstream/downstream/uncertain), and sorted by observed path count, to give more reliable results (so for instance, the first few upstream peers are most likely to be transits). Furthermore, a recap of transits/peers/customers amount (per latest CAIDA data) is displayed.
Announced prefixes aggregated to the most relevant less-specific INET(6)NUM object (actual ).
