title: "LoRaWAN Auditing Framework"
description: "IoT deployments just keep growing and one part of that significant grow is composed of millions of LPWAN (low-power wide-area network) sensors deployed at hundreds of cities (Smart Cities) around the world, also at industries and homes. One of the most used LPWAN technologies is LoRa for which LoRaWAN is the network standard (MAC layer). LoRaWAN is a secure protocol with built in encryption but implementation issues and weaknesses affect the security of most current deployments."
