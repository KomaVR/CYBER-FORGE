description: "The script will start up a webserver allowing the user to run remote lookups and traceroutes directly from the browser.
The web server is actually an  listener waiting for requests, responding to browsers querying through the HTTP protocol. This interface makes for a straightforward integration into user workflow and no need to download any client-side tools.
By simply using a Javascript bookmarklet or custom search engine, it will be possible to launch remote traces and lookups without ever leaving the browser.
Refer to the this section for more information."
