Linux: If your distribution provides it, check for cutter package in your package manager (or cutter-re / rz-cutter). If not available there, we have setup repositories in  for some common distributions. Look at https://software.opensuse.org/package/cutter-re and follow the instructions there. Otherwise download the .AppImage file from our release, make it executable and run as below or use AppImageLauncher.
