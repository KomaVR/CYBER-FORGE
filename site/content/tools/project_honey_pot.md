title: "Project Honey Pot"
description: "is the first and only distributed system for identifying spammers and the spambots they use to scrape addresses from your website. Using the  system you can install addresses that are custom-tagged to the time and IP address of a visitor to your site. If one of these addresses begins receiving email we not only can tell that the messages are spam, but also the exact moment when the address was harvested and the IP address that gathered it."
