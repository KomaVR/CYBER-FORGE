description: "This is a basic toolchain for the RarVM, a virtual machine included with the popular WinRAR compression suite. Rar includes a VM to support custom data transformations to improve data redundancy, and thus improve compression ratios. However, it also represents a widely deployed machine architecture about which very little is known...that is just too tempting a target for exploration to ignore."
