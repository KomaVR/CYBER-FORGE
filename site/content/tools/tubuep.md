title: "Tubuep"
description: "Downloads online videos via yt-dlp, then reuploads them to the Internet Archive for preservation. Note: if you would like to archive comments too, you need to install version 0.0.33 and use the --get-comments flag, however you will still have the new yt-dlp fixes and features, but existing tubeup bugs cannot be fixed, unless you do manual work."
