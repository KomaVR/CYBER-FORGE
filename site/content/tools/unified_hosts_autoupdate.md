title: "Unified Hosts AutoUpdate"
description: "
(for Windows): The  package is purpose-built for this
unified hosts project as well as in active development by community members.
You can install and uninstall any blacklist and keep it automatically up to
date, and can be placed in a shared network location and deployed across an
organization via group policies. And since it is in active development by
community members, your bug reports, feature requests, and other feedback are
most welcome."
