description: "This module lets you check a regex for vulnerability. In JavaScript, regular expressions (regexes) can be \"vulnerable\": susceptible to catastrophic backtracking. If your application is used on the client side, this can be a performance issue. On the server side, this can expose you to Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDOS)."
